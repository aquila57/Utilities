# Analog_Clock

There are three analog clocks in this repository:

clk - Analog clock showing time of day

stopw - Stop watch timer

timer - Count down timer

Each of these clocks is written in XWindows using Bresenham's
algorithm to paint the circle and hands of the clock.

See TESTING for examples of how to run each of these clocks.

See INSTALL for instructions on how to compile these clocks.

See the Digital_Clock repository for three equivalent clocks
filling a console screen using curses with asterisks.
