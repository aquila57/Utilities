Description: Digital clock for X Windows.
Toggles between calendar and relative time.
The purpose of this digital clock is to
minimize resources and real estate on the
screen.  The window icon is updated each
minute, and the window itself is updated
each second.  The active window icon fits
conveniently in the corner of the desktop
without being intrusive.  This program is
especially helpful with the Tiny Window
Manager (twm).
Keywords: digital clock date relative time Xlib active icon
