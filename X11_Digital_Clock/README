The package in this directory is part of an umbrella packaged,
called Utilities.

To install xdgtclk,
	chmod 700 *.sh
	instclk.sh

You may change the font in xdgtclk.c by changing the compile
variable for XFONT in xdgtclk.mak.  The font name "12x24" is
available on Debian.  If you don't have that font on your system,
you'll have to change fonts.  Try to maintain the same font size.
Otherwise you'll have to change the geometry in xdgtclk.c.

* Search for the variable XFONT = \"12x24\"
  in xdgtclk.mak.
* Change the font name from "12x24" to whatever you have
  on your system that is the same size.

After compiling, move the executables to your private bin
directory.

To de-install xdgtclk, run
	deinst.sh
